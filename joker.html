                <p>No one really knows who the Joker is, nor his true origin story. But I believe he was an
                    unsuccessful amateur comedian. After a really bad day and the death of his pregnant wife, he became
                    the petty criminal, Red Hood. Then, during a fight, I accidentally threw him into a pit of acid and it
                    completely dismorphed his face. He then became insane and adopted his new identity: the Joker.</p>
                <p>Of course I know his identity... Or should I say, his three identities! After sitting on a chair, I
                    saw it. Well, it didn't tell me exactly who the Joker was, but it told me how many they were... It
                    caught me so off guard I could only say "No, that's not possible"!</p>

                <p>He was some sort of a genius that used inventive and creative gadgets to rob banks, had this love for
                    weapons and money and wouldn't mind killing people. A weird looking gangster. He was violent and he
                    did it all for the money.
                    In fact, he retired after becoming rich! And he came back when he realized all that money was fake. Ha
                    ha ha! The prankster got pranked!</p>
                <p>He was sadistic, brutal, he made announces on the radio (and now on television) about the
                    things he was about to do, and then HE ACTUALLY DID THEM! A true mass
                    murderer!</p>
                <p>This version of the Joker was the first one to exist. It belonged to the Golden Era (1938-1950).</p>

                <p>Suddenly everything calmed down. The Joker was robbing banks, using his creative gadgets, but was no
                    longer killing people. He became much less violent and much more of a goofball. It was a bit
                    difficult to take him seriously. He was just mildly annoying honestly!</p>
                <p>It was getting ridiculous! We were simply playing pranks on each other! Sure, some seemed more
                    dangerous than others, but no one really got severely hurt by those.</p>
                <p>This version belongs to the calm Silver Age (1956 - 1970).</p>

                <p>So now the Joker is back on killing people, yey! But now it's not because he's a Criminal
                    Mastermind. This is about mental instability. He was starting to play mind tricks and go on killing sprees
                    ... Being all "philosophical" and coming with this mindset of nothing really matters and "this
                    is all a joke".</p>
                <p>With this huge levels of madness and insanity, the Joker became really dangerous! He kept saying that
                    he only existed because of me! So, is it my fault that you're insane? Hell, the Joker even took
                    his face off and then stapled it back like a mask only TO MAKE A POINT! Of course he eventually
                    came "back to normal" because of the Universe Shenanigans and stuff...</p>
                <p>This last version began on the Bronze Age (1970-1985) and only got worse in the Modern
                    Age (1985 - Up to nowadays).</p>

                <p>Everything is a joke for Joker!! Nothing really matters and so the consequences of our
                    actions are meaningless. So he has no remorse in killing people. It doesn't matter. And if we think
                    about it, if in this universe we can get away with killing characters who end up coming back,
                    either by being resurrected by some pit or crystal, or by some shenanigan, that happens...</p>
                <p>Then the Joker is right: nothing really matters in the Universe.</p>
