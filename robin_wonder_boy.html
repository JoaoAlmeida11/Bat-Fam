                <p>Robin is the title that I give to my loyal sidekick.</p>

                <p>I've had many Robins by my side, each one of them special at their own way.</p>

                <p>It all started with this young boy named Dick Grayson. He performed acrobatics with his parents at a
                    circus.
                    Then, one night it all changed... I saw his parents die and his determination to
                    find the man who killed them. He reminded me of myself, you know... So I took him in and trained him to
                    be
                    my partner in crime (-fighting, of course). He then took the name Robin, as her mother used to call
                    him.</p>
                <p>Later he joined a group of Teen Titans, and then, after some time, he wanted to become independent in
                    this business of crime-fighting, so he became Nightwing. I'm so
                    proud of him!</p>
                <p>If you want to see more of him, about our adventures and where he is now, you can check this video:

                <p>So Jason was a troubled kid when I met him. He was trying to steal some parts of my Batmobil when I found
                    him. Needless to say, I took him
                    in. He had potential to become the next Robin. It took 6 months of training. He was a great fighter, but
                    he wasn't anything like Dick... Sure, the kid was strong and skilled, he had this spark in his eyes, but
                    unlike Dick, Jason was moved by anger. He was reckless and disobedient, violent even!</p>

                        So Joker put up this trap to
                        get to me and
                        (with a little help from the Batfans - thanks a lot...) he caught Jason. He then proceeded to beat
                        him
                        to the ground with a crowbar and left him there to die. I was so close to save him, but the place
                        where
                        he was in blew up... Joker had also planted a bomb there (again, thanks a lot Batfans, Jeez).
                        So there I was, with Jason's corpse in my arms, almost crying the death of my son... It was a dark
                        day. But of course shenanigans and stuff and Jason was back alive! And he was also very angry.</p>

                <p>After Jason's... trick... I confess that I was heading down a dark path. Luckily, this kid showed up: Tim
                    Drake. He wanted to be the very best, like no one ever was. (No, not a Pokémon master! Pay attention!)
                    He was an acrobat, just like Dick, and really good at it. He was also very smart! He almost uncovered my
                    secret identity
                    all by himself!</p>

                    <p class="pt-3 texto_r">So one
                        day he decided to steal from Penguin's bank account and give some money for the poor (like Robin
                        Hood). Of course Penguin didn't like that "prank". He didn't like that AT ALL. And so he sent his
                        men to
                        kill Tim's family. Of course I saved the day, after all I'm Batman, and he actually helped me! Then
                        I
                        decided to let him become Robin, but only after I trained him physical an mentally (I didn't want
                        the
                        "Jason thing" to happen again).</p>

                    <p class="texto_r">Tim got a new Robin outfit. The old one just reminded us of Jason.</p>

                    <p class="texto_r">After some time his father
                        convinced
                        him to step out because being Robin is "too dangerous"... Pfff! Come on! He's fighting by my side!
                        How
                        cool is that?! It's not like I would let anything happen to the boy!
                        So Stephanie Brown, Tim's girlfriend (who also happened to be The Spoiler) stepped in to fill
                        Robin's
                        position. But she was stubborn as hell and liked to NOT do as I said! So I got rid of her... Which
                        means
                        I fired her! Gosh! I'm not THAT bad!
                        Luckily I managed to get Tim back on board with me! But then there was this little misunderstanding
                        where
                        I apparently "died"... Tim never believed that and so he became the new vigilante, Red Robin. </p>

                </div>

                <p class="pt-3">He joined
                    a group of Teen Titans and when I came back, things were a bit different... and I had no Robin once
                    more. Again you can check his story right here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntZ2phqS4Lw" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none text-warning">History of Tim Drake! (Red Robin) [Batman]</a>.</p>

                <p>Yes, I have a son. Long story short, I had an affair with Talia Al Ghul (yes, the daughter of Ra's Al
                    Ghul) and she got pregnant. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT! But apparently she managed to get the baby on an
                    artificial womb in order to genetically modify him to be really strong and fast and she trained him to
                    be the perfect killing machine! Then when he turned 10 and his training was complete, she sent him over
                    to ME! And the kid was like "Hello father, I thought you would be taller..." Well boy, I didn't even
                    know you existed until literally now!! What a way to make a first impression...</p>

                    <p class="pt-3 texto_r">But anyways, she sent him over to my care for him to disturb me and my work.
                        Little did she know that she
                        had already done half of my job to train him to become the new Robin! Ah, jokes on you Talia! And the
                        kid liked to be Robin! We bonded there! And I was happy to have a son.
                        Unfortunately, Talia is crazy and she got really mad by seeing ME bond with MY SON Damian, so she put a
                        bounty on his head and started creating these monsters with his DNA... She eventually made a clone of
                        Damian who was bigger and stronger than him. I tried to keep Damian away from all of it, but the kid
                        didn't listen... He got in a fight with his evil clone and... The beast killed him.</p>

                    <p class="texto_r">Again, I was too late.</p>

                    <p class="texto_r">Then things get a little complicated... But in the end I end up bringing my son back to life
                        and he's my
                        current Robin.</p>
